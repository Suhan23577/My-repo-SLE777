ASSIGNMENT 4- Data Wrangling, Visualisation and Sequence Diversity

# Overview
This repository has R tools and a R Markdown report that can be used with RStudio and GitHub to organize data, display it, and analyze sequence variation.  Parts 1 and 2 are both covered. Part 1 has points 1 through 10; Part 2 has points 1 through 6.  In Part 1, the tools bring in and look at two sets of data (gene_expression.tsv and growth_data.csv), make plots, create descriptive statistics, and test hypotheses.  In Part 2, they get coding DNA sequences (CDS) for E. coli and Saprospirales bacteria and then figure out data at the sequence level, like gene counts, nucleotide rates, codon usage bias, and k-mer enrichment.  All of the code works perfectly, produces results that can be repeated, and can be put together into a single, complete report using R Markdown.
